# Installation

## Download

1. You can download "tuxflux" [here]().

2. I'd recommend using [MultiMC](https://multimc.org), otherwise installing this mod will be quite tedious.(No, I was not paid ANY money to endorse their

program, it's just what I came across when my Minecraft was unable to run mods.) If you are aware of how to install mods with the regular Minecraft 

launcher, do so.

## Adding the mod to your Minecraft in MultiMC

1. Click the paper icon with the star, located in the upper-left corner of the window.

2. Select the version you are using(the Minecraft version of the mod, i.e. 1.12.2, 1.10.2, 1.11.2, etc.)

3. Click the "OK" button located in the lower-right corner of the window.

4. Once created, a Minecraft icon with a "âˆž" will appear, right click it.

5. Click "Edit Instance", you should see a window pop up.

6. On the "Versions" tab,(left of the window with the same icon in step 4) click on "Install Forge".

7. A window should pop up, in it, click any version you want(so long as the mod supports the version).

8. Below the versions tab from step 6, click the "Loader Mods" tab.

9. Drag the downloaded mod from it's download location to the blank box in the tab. Alternatively, you can click the "Add" button and select the file's

location manually.

10. Click "Launch" and you're done!
